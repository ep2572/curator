# curator
A private chatroom service featuring drawing and editing capabilities for collaboration, instruction, and review.

To be written in Python.

For now the requirements and roadmap can be found in the [`design document`](curatorDesignDoc.txt)

## Initial Requirements -- WIP
- User must be able to set up private chatroom with a unique roomkey without the need for accounts.
  - User data for a room will be linked to user IP address
  - Data will be cleared once last user leaves the chatroom
- Main body of the page will diplay the sample file (for now just .jpeg, .png, .gif, .bmp) overlayed with an editing layer
- All in attendance will be able to draw or type on the editing layer given host permission.
- Users will be able to save and print modified samples as .jpeg files.

## Design -- WIP
(to be filled)
